    <b>Top speed: 304mph<br/>
    0-60mph: 2.2 seconds</b><br/>
    <p>That old cliche of doing what it says on the tin rears its head here because the Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+ will do, well, 300mph+. More specifically,                        it managed 304mph when the French firm decided to unleash it at Volkswagen’s Ehra-Lessien test track.<br/>   
This 1,600hp mega-machine doesn’t officially hold the world record though, as it only did that run in one direction. To break the record you have to do it twice in opposite directions — which for whatever reason, Bugatti decided not to do.</P>
