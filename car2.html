    <b>Top speed: 238mph<br/>
0-60mph: 3.2 seconds</b><br/>
    <p>The Pagani Huayra is a fantastic looking car. Every detail is exquisite, and it’s more than just a pin-up as well. It has an AMG derived twin-turbocharged V12 engine putting out 730hp and 1,000Nm of torque, enough for a top speed of 238mph.<br/>

The Huayra is made mostly of carbon fibre to keep the weight down, as well as to make it more rigid, and it’s covered in active aero to help it slip through the air more easily.</p>
