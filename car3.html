  <h4>3.Lamborghini Aventador SVJ</h4>
  <b>Top speed: 217mph<br/>
0-60mph: 2.6 seconds</b><br/>
   <p>The fastest naturally-aspirated production car you can buy at the moment comes from the lunatics at Lamborghini. Not all that surprising, really.<br/>

The SVJ is the ultimate version of the Lamborghini Aventador supercar and produces a whopping 770hp from its 6.5-litre V12 engine. Its 217mph top speed is actually the same as the standard Aventador S, but the lighter and gripper SVJ will get there quicker and be faster around corners.</P>
