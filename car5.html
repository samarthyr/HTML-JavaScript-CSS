   <p>It’s been around ages now, but the Audi R8 is still the daddy of Audi’s range — although the new RS e-tron GT could well lay claim to that crown soon. The 620hp R8 Performance is still a properly capable machine though, and its 205mph top speed makes it the fastest car you can get through carwow.</p>
